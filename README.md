Mapping test results in school districts and relevant demographics for the Commonwealth of Virginia


Given lots of rhetoric on reddit and other places re: the quality of Charlottesville public schools vs the private schools in town and knowing that in the greater Charlottesville region there are efforts by some parents to get their kids into the adjacent school district, I thought it would be interesting to look at the Commonwealth's standards of learning exam and the pass/fail rates. Due to school districts being small, data on the school level is often not available because as soon as you combine gender and race at a school the data can suddenly be de-anonymized. Some examples of plots can be found in the figures directory!
